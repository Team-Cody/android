Getting Started
---------------

To get started with MiniCM4pico, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the MiniCM trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/minicm4pico/android.git -b ics

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

If you have a slow internet connection, use:

    repo sync -j1

This tells the repo to fetch projects one by one.
